11.0.0.0.1 Exercise
###################

Make a copy of Intro2.R under a new name, and modify the copy so that it does linear regression of algal growth rate on the natural log of light 
intensity, LogLight=log(Light), and plots the data appropriately. You should end up with a graph that resembles the following.

###################
11.0.0.0.2 Exercise
###################

Run Intro2.R, then enter the command plot(fit) in the console and follow the directions in the console. Figure out what just happened by 
entering ?plot.lm to bring up the help page for the function plot.lm() that carries out a plot() command for an object produced by lm(). 
(This is one example of how R uses the fact that statistical analyses are stored as model objects. fit “knows” what kind of object it is 
(in this case an object of type lm), and so plot(fit) invokes a function that produces plots suitable for an lm object.) Answer: R produced a series of 
diagnostic plots exploring whether or not the fitted linear model is a suitable fit to the data. In each of the plots, the 3 most extreme points (the most 
likely candidates for “outliers”) have been identified according to their sequence in the data set.

###################
11.0.0.0.3 Exercise
###################

Create a plot of growth rate versus light intensity with the xx-axis running from 0 to 120, and the yy-axis running from 1 to 4.

11.0.0.0.4 Exercise
###################

Several graphs can be placed within a single figure by using the par function (short for “parameter”) to adjust the layout of the plot. For example 
the command  par(mfrow=c(m,n)) divides the plotting area into mm rows and nn columns. As a series of graphs is drawn, they are placed along the 
top row from left to right, then along the next row, and so on. mfcol=c(m,n) has the same effect except that successive graphs are drawn down 
the first column, then down the second column, and so on.

Save Intro2.R with a new name and modify the program as follows. Use mfcol=c(2,1) to create graphs of growth rate as a function of Light, 
and of log(growth rate) as a function of log(Light) in the same figure.
Do the same again, using mfcol=c(1,2).

###################
11.0.0.0.5 Exercise
###################

Use ?par to read about other plot control parameters that can be set using par(). Then draw a 2×22×2 set of plots, each showing the line 
y=5x+3y=5x+3 with x running from 3 to 8, but with 4 different line styles and 4 different line colors.

###################
11.0.0.0.6 Exercise
###################

Modify one of your scripts so that at the very end it saves the plot to disk. You can accomplish this using the dev.print() function. Do  
?dev.print to read about this function. Note that you need to specify the file argument to write your graphics to a file; if you don’t, it will try and 
send it to a printer. Also note that many alternative formats are available via the dev argument.
