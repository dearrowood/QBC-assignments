What do the %% and %/% operators do?

9.1.1.0.1 Exercise
###################

What happens when the length of the longer vector is not a multiple of that of the shorter?

###################
9.1.2.0.1 Exercise
###################

Use seq to create the vector v=(1 5 9 13), and to create a vector going from 1 to 5 in increments of 0.2 .

###################
9.1.2.0.2 Exercise
###################

What happens when to is less than from in seq? What result does 3:1 give? This is one of the first “gotchas” R newbies run into.

###################
9.1.3.0.1 Exercise
###################

If you enter v <- z[seq(1,5,2)], what will happen? Make sure you understand why.

###################
9.1.3.0.2 Exercise
###################

Write a one-line command to extract a vector consisting of the second, first, and third elements of z in that order.

###################
9.1.3.0.3 Exercise
###################

What happens when I set the value of an element that doesn’t exist? For example, try: z[9] <- 11

###################
9.1.3.0.4 Exercise
###################

Write code that computes values of: y = (x-1)/(x+1) for x = 1,2,...,10, and plots y versus x with the points plotted and connected by a line.

###################
9.1.3.0.6 Exercise
###################

The sum of the geometric series: 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 +...+r^n approaches the limit 1/(1 - r) for r < 1 as n -> ∞. Take r = 0.5 and n = 10, 
and write a one-line command that creates the vector G = (r^0, r^1, r^2,..., r^n). Compare the sum (using sum()) of this vector to the limimiting
value 1/(1 - r). Repeat for n = 50.

###################
9.1.5.0.2 Exercise
###################

runif(n) is a function that generates a vector of n random, uniformly distributed numbers between 0 and 1. Create a vector of 20 numbers, then
find the subset of those numbers that is less than the mean. More on runif and related functions soon.

###################
9.1.5.0.3 Exercise
###################

Find the positions of the elements that are less than the mean of the vector you just created (e.g. if your vector were (0.1 0.9 0.7 0.3) the
answer would b (1 4)).

###################
9.1.5.0.4 Exercise
###################

Specify two ways to take only the elements in the odd positions (first, third, …) of a vector of arbitrary length.
