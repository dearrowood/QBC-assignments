Check that this works with different vectors T. What happens when T has length 1? What happens when T has length 0? Why? To avoid this 
trap, itâ€™s preferable to use seq_len, seq_along, or seq.int instead of the 1:n construction used above. This and many other R gotchas are 
described in the useful R Inferno (Burns 2012).

> When T has length 1, the resulting plot contains a single point. When T has length 0, R is unable to generate a plot, because it is unable 
   to plot an empty vector. Instead, it returns an error message.

Verify that the above works as intended. How many iterations are needed?

> By adding a counter, we can keep track of the number of iterations our loop performs:

phi <- 20
conv <- FALSE
k <- 1
while (!conv) {
  phi.new <- 1+1/phi
  conv <- phi==phi.new
  phi <- phi.new
  k <- k+1
}

A total of 41 iterations of the loop are performed to compute the Golden Ratio
