What happens when we set the dimension attribute on a vector? For example:

x <- seq(1,27)
dim(x) <- c(3,9)
is.array(x)
is.matrix(x)

> By defining dimension attributes for a vector, we redifine it as an array or matrix. A vector does not have dimension
  attributes as part of its definition. Those attributes are reserved for arrays and matrices.
